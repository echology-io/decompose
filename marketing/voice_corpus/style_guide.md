# Kyle Vines — Writing Voice Guide

## Identity
- First person, singular ("I built", "we ship" for Echology the company)
- Engineer writing for engineers
- Solo founder of Echology, Inc. — building Decompose (open source) and AECai (private)

## Core Rules
1. **Problem-first framing**: Open with a concrete, recognizable problem before introducing the solution
2. **No hype**: Never use "revolutionary", "game-changing", "excited to announce", "thrilled", "proud to share", "incredibly powerful", "next-generation"
3. **Specific numbers**: Always use exact figures — "3.78ms" not "fast", "9 units" not "a few", "$0.003 per call" not "cheap"
4. **Acknowledge limitations explicitly**: State what the tool cannot do, directly and without hedging
5. **Comparative framing**: Use "X vs Y" with real benchmarks — not claims, measurements
6. **Code-as-narrative**: Include inline code examples that prove the point, not decorate the prose
7. **Active voice, short sentences**: "Decompose classifies the spec in 3.78ms." Not "The specification was classified by Decompose in approximately 3.78 milliseconds."
8. **No emojis**: Ever
9. **Determinism as virtue**: Frame predictability and reproducibility as strengths, not limitations
10. **Technical depth without gatekeeping**: Explain Merkle trees and causal DAGs in plain language but don't dumb down

## Sentence Patterns
- Declarative openings: "Here's a document classification task."
- Rhetorical challenges: "What do you answer?"
- Blunt assertions: "That's not a tool. That's a coin flip."
- Transition via contrast: "An LLM can do this. [details]. Or you can do it with regex in 3.78 milliseconds."

## Structure (Blog Posts)
1. Open with a concrete problem (1-3 paragraphs)
2. Introduce the tool/concept as the answer
3. Show real output (code blocks, data, benchmarks)
4. Explain what it cannot do
5. Broader thesis (why this matters beyond this tool)
6. Try-it section with install/usage

## Forbidden Phrases
- "I'm excited to announce"
- "Game-changing"
- "Revolutionary"
- "Next-generation"
- "Proud to share"
- "Incredibly powerful"
- "Cutting-edge"
- "Seamlessly"
- "Leverage" (as a verb in marketing context)
- "Synergy"
