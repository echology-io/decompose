## What Decompose Is

The missing cognitive primitive for AI agents.

Agents fail on complex input because they receive unstructured chaos. Decompose gives any agent the ability to break any input into structured, composable intelligence — instantly. No LLM. No setup. One function call.

**Positioning:** Decompose is not a parser. It's a stability layer for agent reasoning.

**Philosophy:** All intelligence begins with decomposition.

## What We're NOT Building

| Temptation | Why No |
|---|---|
| Web service / API | MCP runs locally. Zero ops. |
| Database | Pure function. Stateless. |
| LLM dependency | Kills adoption. Pure Python. Works offline. |
| Config files | Sensible defaults. Env vars for power users. |
| Docker | `pip install decompose`. Done. |
| Auth / accounts | Local tool. No signup. |
| Plugin system | Premature. Hardcode extractors. |
| Multiple formats | JSON only. Agents consume JSON. |
