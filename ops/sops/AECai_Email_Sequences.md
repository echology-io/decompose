# AECai Email Sequences

**Author:** Kyle Vines, PE — Echology, Inc.
**Version:** 1.0 — February 2026
**Purpose:** Three outbound email sequences for AECai consulting launch.

## Sequence A — Warm Connection (for people who know you)

### Email A1: The Reconnection
**Subject:** Quick update + something I built
**When:** Day 1 of outreach

Hi {{FirstName}},

It's been a while — hope things at {{Company}} are going well.

I left {{LastFirm}} and started a company called Echology. We built AECai — a document intelligence platform for AEC firms. It reads specs, contracts, and submittals and extracts everything that matters: every standard referenced, every "shall" clause, every deadline buried in boilerplate.

I built it because every firm I worked at had the same problem — documents with legal weight being processed by people who didn't have time to read them.

Would love to catch up. Free for 15 minutes this week?

Best,
Kyle

### Email A2: The Value Drop (if no reply)
**Subject:** RE: Quick update + something I built
**When:** Day 4

Hey {{FirstName}},

One thing I forgot to mention — we process a sample of your firm's documents through the pipeline and deliver a full report as a discovery assessment. Every standard cross-referenced against jurisdiction adoptions, obligations flagged, entities extracted.

$800, credits 100% toward a full engagement. No data leaves your building.

If that sounds interesting, happy to walk you through what the report looks like.

### Email A3: The Soft Close (if still no reply)
**Subject:** RE: Quick update + something I built
**When:** Day 10

{{FirstName}} — totally understand if the timing isn't right. Just wanted to make sure this landed.

If you're not the right person for this, I'd appreciate a pointer to whoever handles document control or digital transformation at {{Company}}.

Either way, good to reconnect.

## Sequence B — Buying Signal Trigger (for cold prospects showing intent)

Use when: Prospect company is hiring document control, had a senior departure, won a large contract, or appears in industry news for compliance/digital transformation.

### Email B1: The Pattern Interrupt
**Subject:** {{Company}}'s {{signal}} — might be relevant
**When:** Within 48 hours of signal detection

Hi {{FirstName}},

I saw {{Company}} {{signal_description}} — congratulations.

I run Echology. We built AECai, a document intelligence platform that reads engineering specs, contracts, and submittals and turns them into structured, searchable data. Every standard referenced, every obligation flagged, every deadline extracted.

Firms going through {{what_they're_going_through}} usually discover they're sitting on years of unstructured institutional knowledge. That's exactly what our system indexes.

Worth a 15-minute conversation?

### Email B2: The Proof Point
**Subject:** RE: {{Company}}'s {{signal}} — might be relevant
**When:** Day 5

Hey {{FirstName}},

Quick follow-up. Here's a concrete example of what AECai finds in a typical spec package:

- 47 standards referenced, 3 superseded by current jurisdiction code
- 12 "shall" clauses buried in boilerplate sections
- 2 submittal deadlines that conflict with the project schedule
- Liquidated damages clause referencing the wrong party

That's from a single project. We find this in every firm's documents.

We offer a $800 discovery assessment — we process a sample of your documents and deliver the full report. Credits 100% toward a full engagement.

No procurement hassle. No data leaves your building.

### Email B3: The Authority Close
**Subject:** RE: {{Company}}'s {{signal}} — might be relevant
**When:** Day 12

{{FirstName}},

I spent 13 years inside engineering firms — designer, CAD manager, CEO of a geotech firm. I've sat in every seat. I built AECai because I lived the problem.

If document management, compliance tracking, or knowledge capture is on your roadmap for this year, I'd like to show you what we're doing. No pitch — just a look at the system.

If you're not the right person, a point in the right direction would be appreciated.

Best,
Kyle

## Sequence C — Retirement/Knowledge Loss Trigger

Use when: Prospect firm has senior engineer retiring or departing, knowledge management hiring, or "institutional knowledge" mentioned in company communications.

### Email C1: The Pain Point
**Subject:** Before {{RetiringPerson}} walks out the door
**When:** Within 1 week of signal

Hi {{FirstName}},

I noticed {{Company}} {{departure_context}}.

When a principal or senior engineer leaves, they take decades of project knowledge with them — which specs to watch, which contractors to double-check, which jurisdictions have unusual requirements.

We built AECai to capture that knowledge before it walks out the door. The system reads every document your firm has produced or received and indexes it by meaning, not keywords. When the next engineer needs to know "how did we handle ASTM C150 on the last DOT project," the answer is there.

Would 15 minutes be worth it to see how this works?

### Email C2: The Cost of Inaction
**Subject:** RE: Before {{RetiringPerson}} walks out the door
**When:** Day 5

{{FirstName}},

One thing I should have mentioned — the knowledge loss problem compounds.

Every project your firm completes adds documents to the archive. Every departure removes someone who knew what was in them. A year from now, your firm will have more documents and fewer people who understand them.

Our discovery assessment processes a sample of your documents and shows you exactly what's in there — standards, obligations, deadlines, risk areas. $800, 2-week turnaround.

If nothing else, it's a useful snapshot of your institutional knowledge.

### Email C3: The Gentle Nudge
**Subject:** RE: Before {{RetiringPerson}} walks out the door
**When:** Day 14

{{FirstName}} — last note on this. If the timing isn't right now, totally understand.

If you'd like to see what the system finds in your documents whenever you're ready, just reply and I'll set it up. No expiration on the offer.

## Usage Notes

- **Sequence A** is highest priority — warm intros convert 3-5x better than cold
- **Sequence B** triggers should be set up in the marketing agent (shipping event detection)
- **Sequence C** is the highest-emotion sequence — use sparingly, only when the signal is clear
- All sequences assume the Sales Playbook discovery call script for booked meetings
- Track all sends in Notion CRM (Clients DB → Interactions)
- Response time target: reply to any response within 4 hours during business hours
- If prospect replies with interest, skip remaining sequence and schedule call directly
