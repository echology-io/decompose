            <p class="sub">Echology modernizes technology to optimize workflows for engineering firms, where it makes sense. We build simulation-aware intelligence tools that understand documents the way engineers do — structurally, precisely, and with full accountability.</p>

            <p class="section-label">The Problem</p>
            <h2 class="section-title">Documents are the dark matter of every industry.</h2>
            <p class="section-desc" style="text-align:left; max-width:100%;">
                Every firm — engineering, legal, financial, construction — drowns in documents. Specs, contracts, reports, submittals, change orders. Thousands per project. Millions per firm.
            </p>
            <p class="section-desc" style="text-align:left; max-width:100%; margin-top: 16px;">
                Existing AI tools treat documents as flat text. They dump content into a context window and hope for the best. But documents have structure — authority levels, risk classifications, legal obligations, cross-references, numerical precision requirements. Flat text loses all of that.
            </p>
            <p class="section-desc" style="text-align:left; max-width:100%; margin-top: 16px;">
                The tools exist — embeddings, vector databases, LLMs. All accessible. What's missing is the architecture that connects them correctly. That gap is where Echology operates.
            </p>
            <p class="section-desc" style="text-align:left; max-width:100%; margin-top: 16px;">
                Echology builds tools that understand that structure. Our simulation-aware architecture doesn't just read documents — it decomposes them into classified semantic units, verifies claims against known standards, and produces auditable intelligence.

                    <h3>Local-first</h3>
                    <p>Your data stays on your hardware. No cloud. No API keys. No data leaving the building. This isn't a feature — it's a requirement for firms that handle privileged, ITAR-controlled, or client-confidential content.</p>

                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Simulation-aware</h3>
                    <p>Our systems don't just process — they model. Causal graphs explain every classification. Multi-channel verification catches errors. Merkle trees make outputs tamper-evident. Attention budgets allocate compute where it matters. Every decision is logged, explainable, and auditable.</p>

                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Deterministic where it counts</h3>
                    <p>AI is powerful but unpredictable. We use AI for classification and reasoning, but wrap it in deterministic systems — hash-chained audit trails, regex-based authority detection, schema validation. The output is reproducible and defensible.</p>

                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Built for professionals</h3>
                    <p>Our users are engineers, PMs, and principals at firms that build bridges, hospitals, and power plants. They need tools that are accurate, accountable, and auditable. Not chatbots — intelligence infrastructure.</p>

            <p class="section-desc" style="text-align:left; max-width:100%;">
                Echology, Inc. is a Delaware C-Corp based in Charleston, South Carolina. Founded by Kyle Vines.
            </p>
            <p class="section-desc" style="text-align:left; max-width:100%; margin-top: 16px;">
                Kyle spent 13+ years in geotechnical and civil engineering. He acquired and ran a geotech firm. His last role was at LaBella Associates (ENR Top 200), where he adopted AI tools and validated them across a team of 200 engineers. The tools stuck. That experience — deploying AI inside a real engineering firm and watching it work — is what Echology builds on.
            </p>
            <p class="section-desc" style="text-align:left; max-width:100%; margin-top: 16px;">
                I started Echology because I watched the same pattern repeat everywhere. Teams get access to LLMs, embeddings, vector databases — and then throw raw documents at the model because nobody showed them there's a step before that. A structural step where you classify what matters before reasoning begins.
            </p>
            <p class="section-desc" style="text-align:left; max-width:100%; margin-top: 16px;">
                AECai is the platform — a consulting-first engagement where we run your documents through the pipeline and show you what's there. Decompose is the open-source credibility artifact that proves the architecture works. Consulting finds the right fit. Tools deliver the value.
