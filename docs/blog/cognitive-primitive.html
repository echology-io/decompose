    <section>
        <div class="container post-body">

            <p>Here's a six-section construction specification. Your agent needs to read it and figure out what matters. Go:</p>

            <div class="code-block">
<span class="cmt">## 1. Scope of Work</span>
The Contractor shall provide all labor, materials...
per ACI 318-19 and ASTM C150-22.

<span class="cmt">## 2. General Information</span>
This project is located at the corner of Main Street...
The architect of record is Smith & Associates.

<span class="cmt">## 3. Structural Requirements</span>
Maximum allowable soil bearing pressure shall not
exceed 4,000 psf... ASTM A615, Grade 60.

<span class="cmt">## 4. Safety Requirements</span>
All work shall comply with OSHA 1926 safety standards.
Workers must wear hard hats, safety glasses...

<span class="cmt">## 5. Payment Terms</span>
Retainage of 10%... Liquidated damages of $2,500
per calendar day...

<span class="cmt">## 6. Background</span>
For reference, similar projects in the region have
typically required 8-12 months for foundation work.
            </div>

            <p>A raw LLM will read all six sections with equal attention. It will spend the same amount of compute on "The architect of record is Smith &amp; Associates" as it does on "Liquidated damages of $2,500 per calendar day." It will treat the background section with the same importance as the safety section.</p>

            <p>This is the fundamental problem. <strong>Your agent reads everything equally because it has no structure to tell it what matters.</strong></p>

            <h2>What a cognitive primitive is</h2>

            <p>A CPU doesn't reason about data. It has primitives: ADD, COMPARE, LOAD, STORE. High-level thinking is composed from these low-level operations.</p>

            <p>AI agents work the same way. Your orchestration layer &mdash; LangChain, CrewAI, raw API calls, whatever &mdash; composes from primitives. The usual ones: retrieve, summarize, generate, classify. But there's one missing from the stack.</p>

            <blockquote><p>Decomposition: splitting raw text into classified, prioritized semantic units before reasoning begins.</p></blockquote>

            <p>This isn't summarization. Summarization loses information. It's not retrieval. Retrieval requires a query. It's not classification in the ML sense. There's no model, no training data, no probabilities.</p>

            <p>It's <strong>structural analysis</strong>. The same document goes in. Classified units come out. Every time. In 4 milliseconds.</p>

            <h2>What decomposition looks like</h2>

            <p>That six-section spec above? One function call:</p>

            <div class="code-block">
<span class="key">from</span> decompose <span class="key">import</span> decompose_text
result = decompose_text(spec_text)   <span class="cmt"># ~14ms avg, 6 units</span>
            </div>

            <p>Here's what your agent sees instead of 2,045 characters of raw text:</p>

            <div class="attention-bar"><span class="label">4. Safety Requirements</span><div class="bar-bg"><div class="bar" style="width: 80%;"></div></div><span class="score">8.0</span></div>
            <div class="attention-bar"><span class="label">5. Payment Terms</span><div class="bar-bg"><div class="bar" style="width: 30%;"></div></div><span class="score">3.0</span></div>
            <div class="attention-bar"><span class="label">1. Scope of Work</span><div class="bar-bg"><div class="bar" style="width: 20%;"></div></div><span class="score">2.0</span></div>
            <div class="attention-bar"><span class="label">3. Structural Requirements</span><div class="bar-bg"><div class="bar" style="width: 6%;"></div></div><span class="score">0.6</span></div>
            <div class="attention-bar"><span class="label">2. General Information</span><div class="bar-bg"><div class="bar" style="width: 4%;"></div></div><span class="score">0.4</span></div>
            <div class="attention-bar"><span class="label">6. Background</span><div class="bar-bg"><div class="bar" style="width: 1%;"></div></div><span class="score">0.1</span></div>

            <p>Section 4 scored <span class="inline-stat">8.0</span>. Section 6 scored <span class="inline-stat">0.1</span>. Your agent now knows which 30% of the document to send to the LLM and which 70% to skip.</p>

            <h3>Why Safety scored 8.0</h3>

            <p>Four words triggered it: <code>shall</code> (mandatory authority), <code>must</code> (mandatory), <code>required</code> (mandatory), and <code>comply</code> (compliance risk). The attention formula is straightforward:</p>

            <div class="code-block">
authority_weight = <span class="num">1.0</span>   <span class="cmt"># mandatory: 4 pattern matches</span>
risk_multiplier  = <span class="num">2.0</span>   <span class="cmt"># compliance category</span>
attention = min(<span class="num">10.0</span>, auth_score &times; risk_mult)
         = min(<span class="num">10.0</span>, <span class="num">4.0</span> &times; <span class="num">2.0</span>) = <span class="num">8.0</span>
            </div>

            <p>No machine learning. No embeddings. The word "shall" has meant "mandatory" since <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119">RFC 2119</a> was published in 1997. It means the same thing in a building spec, a software spec, and a procurement contract. Regex is the right tool here.</p>

            <h3>Why Background scored 0.1</h3>

            <p>No mandatory keywords. No risk indicators. One "permissive" match from generic language. The attention formula bottoms out:</p>

            <div class="code-block">
authority_weight = <span class="num">0.35</span>  <span class="cmt"># permissive</span>
risk_multiplier  = <span class="num">0.3</span>   <span class="cmt"># informational</span>
attention = <span class="num">0.35</span> &times; <span class="num">0.3</span> = <span class="num">0.1</span>
            </div>

            <p>"Similar projects in the region have typically required 8-12 months." That's useful context, but it's not an obligation, not a risk, and not something your agent needs to act on. Attention: 0.1.</p>

            <h2>What else the primitive extracts</h2>

            <p>Attention is the headline, but each unit carries a full classification:</p>

            <div class="panels">
                <div class="panel accent">
                    <div class="panel-label">Unit 5 &mdash; Payment Terms</div>
<span class="hi">authority: <span class="str">mandatory</span></span>
<span class="hi">risk: <span class="str">financial</span></span>
<span class="hi">attention: <span class="num">3.0</span></span>

<span class="hi">entities: <span class="str">[]</span></span>
<span class="hi">dates: <span class="str">["December 31, 2026"]</span></span>
<span class="hi">financial: <span class="str">["$2,500", "10%"]</span></span>

<span class="str">&rarr; Deadline, dollar amount, percentage.
   All extracted. All typed.</span>
                </div>
                <div class="panel">
                    <div class="panel-label">Unit 3 &mdash; Structural Requirements</div>
<span class="hi">authority: <span class="str">mandatory</span></span>
<span class="hi">risk: <span class="str">informational</span></span>
<span class="hi">attention: <span class="num">0.6</span></span>
<span class="hi">actionable: <span class="bool">true</span></span>
<span class="hi">irreducible: <span class="bool">true</span></span>
<span class="hi">entities: <span class="str">["ASTM A615"]</span></span>
<span class="hi">dates: <span class="str">["January 15, 2026"]</span></span>
<span class="hi">financial: <span class="str">[]</span></span>
<span class="hi">irreducibility: <span class="str">PRESERVE_VERBATIM</span></span>

<span class="str">&rarr; "4,000 psf" and "4,000 psi" are
   engineering values. Cannot paraphrase.
   PRESERVE_VERBATIM.</span>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>Notice the structural requirements unit: low attention score (0.6) but marked <code>PRESERVE_VERBATIM</code>. Your agent might skip this unit for initial triage, but if it ever summarizes the document, it knows: do not paraphrase "4,000 psf." That number is irreducible. Getting it wrong kills people.</p>

            <h2>How this changes agent architecture</h2>

            <p>Without a decomposition primitive, your agent pipeline looks like this:</p>

            <div class="code-block">
<span class="dim">document &rarr; chunk &rarr; embed &rarr; retrieve &rarr; LLM &rarr; answer</span>

<span class="cmt"># Every chunk treated equally.
# The LLM decides what matters.
# 100% of tokens go to the model.</span>
            </div>

            <p>With decomposition:</p>

            <div class="code-block">
document &rarr; <span class="key">decompose</span> &rarr; route &rarr; LLM &rarr; answer

<span class="cmt"># Each unit has authority, risk, attention.
# High-attention units go to the model.
# Low-attention units get skipped or summarized.
# ~30% of tokens go to the model.</span>
            </div>

            <p>The difference isn't just efficiency. It's <strong>correctness</strong>. Three things change:</p>

            <h3>1. Attention allocation</h3>

            <p>Instead of the LLM deciding what to focus on (which it does poorly for technical documents), the attention scores pre-allocate compute. Safety-critical content gets processed. Background doesn't. Your agent acts like an experienced engineer who knows which sections of a spec to read first.</p>

            <h3>2. Irreducibility awareness</h3>

            <p>When a unit is marked <code>PRESERVE_VERBATIM</code>, your agent knows not to summarize or paraphrase it. "4,000 psf" stays "4,000 psf" &mdash; it doesn't become "about 4,000 psf" or "approximately 4 kips per square foot." This is the difference between a useful tool and a liability.</p>

            <h3>3. Entity-aware routing</h3>

            <p>Decompose extracts every standards reference (ASTM, ASCE, IBC, OSHA), every date, every dollar amount. Your agent can route by entity type: send OSHA references to a safety compliance chain, send financial values to a payment audit chain, send ACI references to a structural analysis chain. No embedding similarity search required. Just pattern matching on structured metadata.</p>

            <h2>What this is not</h2>

            <p>Decompose is not a replacement for LLMs. It's a preprocessor. Some things it explicitly cannot do:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Nuance.</strong> "The contractor should consider" and "The contractor should comply" both classify as <code>directive</code>. An LLM knows these have different implications.</li>
                <li><strong>Cross-reference.</strong> If section 3 says "per the geotechnical report" and section 1 references a different report, Decompose doesn't catch the conflict. That's what your model is for.</li>
                <li><strong>Intent.</strong> Decompose classifies structure, not meaning. It knows "shall" means mandatory. It doesn't know what the sentence is trying to accomplish.</li>
                <li><strong>Domain reasoning.</strong> "4,000 psf" is flagged as an engineering value. Decompose doesn't know whether 4,000 psf is reasonable for this soil type. A domain expert (human or LLM) does.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This is the point. Your LLM handles nuance, cross-referencing, intent, and domain reasoning. Decompose handles everything else &mdash; the mechanical work of splitting, classifying, scoring, and extracting &mdash; so the LLM can focus on what it's actually good at.</p>

            <h2>Why it has to be deterministic</h2>

            <p>Imagine an agent processing safety compliance documents. Run it Monday, it flags section 4 as safety-critical. Run it Wednesday, it classifies the same section as "advisory" because the LLM was slightly more creative that day.</p>

            <p>That's not a tool. That's a coin flip.</p>

            <p>Decompose returns the same output for the same input. Every time. There's no temperature knob, no sampling variance, no model drift. If "shall" matched <code>mandatory</code> yesterday, it matches <code>mandatory</code> today. If section 4 scored 8.0 in production, it scores 8.0 in your test suite. You can write assertions against it. You can audit it.</p>

            <p>For industries where documents have legal weight &mdash; construction, healthcare, defense, finance &mdash; determinism isn't a nice-to-have. It's table stakes.</p>

            <h2>The primitive pattern</h2>

            <p>The broader point: <strong>agents need more primitives, not more parameters.</strong></p>

            <p>The current trajectory of AI tooling is: make the model bigger, give it more context, add more retrieval. This works, until it doesn't. A 200K context window doesn't help if 70% of the tokens are background noise. RAG doesn't help if the embeddings can't distinguish a mandatory requirement from an informational note.</p>

            <p>Primitives help because they operate at a different layer. They don't compete with the LLM &mdash; they feed it. A well-decomposed document makes every model work better: smaller context, higher signal, structured metadata to route on.</p>

            <p>Decompose is one primitive. There should be more. Entity resolution, temporal ordering, reference graph construction, obligation tracking &mdash; these are all deterministic operations that agents currently outsource to the model. Every one of them could be a regex-and-heuristics library that runs in milliseconds and gives the LLM structured inputs instead of raw text.</p>

            <p>We're building these at <a href="/">Echology</a>. Decompose is the first one we open-sourced.</p>

            <h2>Try it</h2>
